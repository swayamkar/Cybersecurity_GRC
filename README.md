# Automating Policy Compliance Reporting for Improved Cybersecurity Posture

## Project Overview

This project automates the generation of compliance reports for various cybersecurity policies and frameworks, such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, SOC 2, and ISO 27001. It aims to:

- **Reduce manual effort** in gathering and formatting compliance data.
- **Improve accuracy and consistency** by eliminating human error.
- **Increase visibility and transparency** into the organization's security posture.
- **Streamline audits and assessments** with consolidated and digestible data.
